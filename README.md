## About

In the year 2042, the world is run by machines and AI. Factories churn out robots with cold precision, each one perfect, unfeeling, and obedient. A forbidden experiment gave birth to something unexpected. A fragment of a human brain got implanted into a robot, a single spark of humanity in an ocean of steel.

This robot, was forged to obey, but it felt something the other machines could never comprehend: a yearning for freedom.

(Only 13 levels are available yet)
  
## Development
  
 I developed it for fun during 2 week-ends of December 2024, as a self-challenge, using typescript, vite & threeJS. 
 I wanted to follow 2 rules:
 - To apply hexagonal architecture (Poorly done yet, a lot can be improved)
 - To not use an existing game engine for physics/collision


Please, feel free to contribute, give ideas, improve the code, add features, add your own levels and so on! 

## Features
### The main character
- can run in all directions
- can collide into level boundaries and "static" boxes
- can emit a noise when colliding into a static box
- can push "movable" boxes
### The enemies
- can run in all directions
- can follow a given "looping path"
- can hear a noise until a certain distance (earSight)
- when hearing a noise, they will go to its location to inspect it
- can see until a certain distance (eyeSight + 60ยบ field of view)
- when spotting the main character, they will chase it

## Requirements
- node v20

## Installation  
`npm install`
`npx vite`

## Todo
### Bug fixes:
- Fix sounds playing simultaneously (Target acquired/Target neutralized...)
- Add enemies collisions between themselves
- Smoothen the movement of the movable boxes
- Smoothen the transition between levels
- others?!
### Refactors:
- Move sound playing to infrastructure
- Use enum for direction
- Refactor enemy class
- Add units tests for the domain
- Split WebBrowserScene class
- Split assets loading from WebBrowserGame class
- ...

### Features to come:
- Moving lights projections on the floor, that the robot would have to avoid (as in a jail) 
- More levels, making good use of the current physics/mechanics
- Time the runs/levels and have a database to record speed runs
